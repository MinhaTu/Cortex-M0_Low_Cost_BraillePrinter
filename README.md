# Slippery-Slope
## Directional Noise-cancelling  Headphones applied to treatment of people within the Autism Spectrum
### Description
This project tries to implement an Active Noise-cancelling Headphone which is able to help autistic people in moments of crisis. Basically, this instrument can let specified ranges of frequencies reach to the listener's ear canal, such as a human voice, while blocking other unwanted noises, such as car engines and indistinguishable chatters.
