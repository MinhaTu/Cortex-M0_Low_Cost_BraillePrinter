## Low-cost Braille Printer using Cortex-M0 and recycled materials
### Description
This project aims to build a functional Braille Printer that can help in the process of writting and reading in the Braille system. Briefly speaking, our printer works with a CNC-like mechanism that moves in the axis X,Y in which there is a needle coupled to a stepper motor. Controlled by the Cortex-M0 processor by means of an USB Interface, the needle is reponsible for making the Braille writting itself, the dots.
